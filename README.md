# CryptoClustering

In this project, I utilized Python and unsupervised learning techniques to predict the impact of 24-hour and 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies. Leveraging Python's capabilities and employing unsupervised learning methods, I developed predictive models to assess the potential influence of price fluctuations on various cryptocurrencies.
